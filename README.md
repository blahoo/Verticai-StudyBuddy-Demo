Verticai, a study buddy with multi language support with text to speech and speech ouput features.
Under the hood, it uses the chatgpt api and prepromts to curate a study buddy for everybody.

This was a demo built in small hackathon and will be worked to give an actual functioning demo... without winapi and pydub bugs DX

built with streamlit, openai whisper, chatgpt api, google text to speech, and other oopen source packages
